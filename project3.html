    <!-- Description of destination -->
        
        <p>This beautiful, upscale island is the perfect place for your next vacation. Capri has hotels, shopping,  designer fashions, limoncello and handmade leather sandals. One of its best-known natural sites is the Blue Grotto, a dark cavern where the sea glows electric blue, the result of sunlight passing through an underwater cave. This island is also home to many yachts and boat houses.</p>

    <h3>Reviews</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>"This is an island with character and charisma. Much more than a playground for the rich. The walkways and ruins are fascinating with epic views across the island. The plaza at the top of the funicular is a great place to view the mainland. There are also lovely beaches where the water is warm."</li>
        <li>"Simply the most beautiful place that I have ever been."</li>
        <li>"LOVE this island off the cost of Naples. Visited a hidden beach on the North side near the love rock and itâ€™s breathtaking and quiet. Beautiful scenery."</li>
